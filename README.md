# ü©∏ BloodConnect ‚Äì Blood Donation Management System

A full-stack web platform designed to **streamline the entire blood donation lifecycle** ‚Äî from donor registration and eligibility screening to appointment scheduling and QR-based verification.  
Built using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React**, BloodConnect simplifies donor‚Äìadmin coordination while ensuring efficiency, transparency, and security.

## üö® Problem Statement

Traditional blood donation processes are often **manual, inefficient, and error-prone**.  
Hospitals and donation centers struggle with:
- Managing donor eligibility and scheduling efficiently.  
- Handling repeated registrations and last-minute ineligibility issues.  
- Tracking appointments and verifying donor identities accurately.  
- Monitoring donation activity and center performance.  

These inefficiencies lead to **time wastage**, **donor drop-offs**, and **underutilized resources** in donation centers.

## üí° Solution

**BloodConnect** digitizes and automates the entire donation workflow:
- Donors can register, check eligibility, and book slots online.  
- Admins can manage center operations, view analytics, and verify donors via QR codes.  
- The system ensures that only **eligible donors** are scheduled, **reducing congestion and improving efficiency** at donation centers.  

By automating donor screening and appointment management, BloodConnect helps **save time**, **optimize capacity**, and **increase overall donation throughput**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üë• Role-Based Authentication
Secure login and registration using **JWT**, with separate dashboards for donors and admins.

### üßæ Donor Eligibility Screening
Interactive health questionnaire that evaluates donor readiness based on predefined medical criteria ‚Äî **preventing ineligible donors** from booking slots and **saving valuable time for center as well as ineligible persons**.

### üìÖ Appointment Scheduling & Verification
- Real-time slot booking system with **capacity-based availability** and **conflict prevention**.  
- Integrated **QR-based verification** for instant donor check-in, ensuring authenticity and traceability.

### üîç Donor Filtering & Search
Admins can easily **search and filter donors** based on name, phone number, blood group, or eligibility status.

### üë§ Personalized Donor & Admin Management
- Donors can view their complete donation history, eligibility status, and next donation date.  
- Admins can dynamically update center settings such as total beds and slot durations.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Smart Eligibility Status Updates
Automatic transition of donor status from **"Deferred" ‚Üí "Pending Screening"** after 3 months ‚Äî implemented without external schedulers.
